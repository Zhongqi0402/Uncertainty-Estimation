# Uncertainty-Estimation
`hmm.py` contains the algorithm implementation, namely forward-backward recursion and Viterbi algorithm to find most likely sequeces.  

`env.py` is a simulation of the real world environment, where there are different states and observations. Transition matrix and anything needed to simulate real-world behaviour is in this file.
